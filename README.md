## Work Experience

### Software Developer at Woovly India Pvt Ltd (Jun 2022 - Present)

As a software developer at Woovly, I have been working on various aspects of the platform to ensure that users have the best shopping experience. My main focus has been on backend development, where I have designed scalable and configurable APIs that are consumed by the Woovly Android and iOS apps. I have also fixed backend bug reports to ensure the smooth functioning of the Woovly app. One of my major achievements has been to migrate the codebase from a monolithic architecture towards a microservice architecture, which has improved the app's overall performance. I have also written a backend service that has improved collection search and fuzzy search, allowing users to apply filters that provide a good catalog experience. Additionally, I have written another backend service that provides post recommendations to related post videos, which helps users to understand the product better. Another important project that I have worked on is setting up Magento2 for headless, which can be used by the frontend, Android app, and iOS app. I have implemented custom Magento2 extensions, content management systems, and order management systems using a range of tools and technologies such as Node.js, JavaScript, Magento2, SQL, Elastic Stack (ELK), NPM, Elasticsearch, Enterprise Search, Logstash, Nginx, Apache2, GraphQL, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Kibana.

### Software Engineer Intern at IndyWise (Jul 2021 - Sep 2021)

I completed a two-month internship as a Software Engineer with IndyWise from July 2021 to September 2021. During my internship, I worked remotely with a team of experienced developers and gained hands-on experience with Node.js, SQL, REST APIs, TypeScript, and MySQL. My responsibilities included developing and testing software solutions, debugging code, and participating in team meetings to discuss project progress. This internship provided me with valuable experience working on real-world projects and collaborating with a team of professionals in a fast-paced environment.
